# CatCatching
This is a cat catching game. There are 5 boxes. In one of the boxes a cat is hidden. You can guess where the cat is hidden. If you guess wrong, the cat will move to a box next to it. I'm still trying to work on a parallel timer that starts with the while loop but have not yet worked it out with threading and time.
